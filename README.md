# Introduction
The PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository contains a treasure trove of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal of this project is to extract, process, and visualize this data in an interactive and user-friendly manner. By leveraging technologies like Streamlit and Plotly, we aim to create a dynamic dashboard that provides valuable insights into the data.

# Technologies Used
  **Streamlit**: A Python library for creating interactive web applications with minimal effort.
  
  **Plotly:** Used for creating dynamic and visually appealing plots and charts on the dashboard.
  
  **SqlLite3 Database:** Utilized for storing structured data for further analysis.
  
  **Git:** Employed for version control, enabling collaborative development and easy management of codebase changes.

# Approach
  **Data Extraction:** Extract data from the PhonePe Pulse GitHub repository through scripting and clone it.
  
  **Data Transformation:** Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps.
  
  **Database Management:** Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and retrieval.
  
  **Dashboard Creation:** Create a live geo-visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
  
  **Data Integration:** Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
  
  **User Interaction:** Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display on the dashboard.

# Learning Outcomes
  **Data Extraction and Processing:** Learn how to use GitHub cloning to extract data and preprocess it using Python libraries like Pandas.
  
  **Database Management:** Understand how to use MySQL for storing and retrieving data efficiently.
  
  **Visualization and Dashboard Creation:** Master the creation of interactive and visually appealing dashboards using Streamlit and Plotly.
  
  **Geo-Visualization:** Learn to create and display data on a map using Plotly's geo map functions.
  
  **Dynamic Updating:** Implement a dashboard that dynamically updates based on the latest data in a database.
  
  **Project Development and Deployment:** Learn the end-to-end process of developing a comprehensive and user-friendly solution, from data extraction to dashboard deployment.
